      <h1>Who am <span class="highlight" id="nimesh">I?</span></h1>
      <p>I am a passionate Brand Identity Designer and freelancer, dedicated to crafting creative and engaging solutions across various design disciplines. My expertise spans Brand Identity, Logo Design, Packaging, UI/UX, and general Graphic Design, allowing me to bring a holistic approach to each project I undertake. Despite my formal education being rooted in computer science with Mathematics as an undergraduate student at the University of Ruhuna, I have pursued my design career through self-study and relentless practice. Since embarking on this journey in 2021, I have honed my skills to deliver visually compelling and strategically sound designs that resonate with audiences and meet clients' needs.</p>

  <div class="intro-text2">
                  <p>My self-study process as a designer is a blend of structured online learning and personal artistic exploration. I primarily use YouTube and various online learning platforms, which provide a wealth of tutorials, expert insights, and practical demonstrations that help me build and refine my skills. These resources have been invaluable in teaching me the technical aspects of design software and innovative design techniques. Additionally, I draw from my background in art, including drawing, painting, and other creative pursuits, which allows me to approach design with a unique perspective. By combining traditional art techniques with modern design principles, I continuously experiment with new styles and mediums, ensuring my work is both technically proficient and creatively original.</p>

      <p>In my design work, I utilize a variety of software and techniques to bring my creative visions to life. My favorite tool is Adobe Illustrator, which I primarily use for logo design due to its powerful vector graphics capabilities. For image editing and manipulation, I rely on Adobe Photoshop, which allows me to create stunning visual effects and detailed compositions. When it comes to animations, Adobe After Effects is my go-to software, enabling me to add dynamic motion to my projects.

          Recently, I have been expanding my skills into UI/UX design, using Figma and Adobe XD to create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. These tools offer collaborative features and prototyping capabilities that are essential for modern UI/UX design workflows. Additionally, I incorporate traditional art techniques into my digital work by using an iPad, Apple Pencil, and Procreate for drawing and sketching. This setup allows me to seamlessly blend hand-drawn elements with digital design, enhancing the creativity and originality of my projects.</p>
